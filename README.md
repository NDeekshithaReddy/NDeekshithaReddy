## Hi there 👋
I’m Deekshitha Reddy, a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I enjoy building thoughtful, user-centric products and turning ideas into polished, working systems. 

My interests sit at the intersection of Android development, system design, and applied AI/ML. I’ve worked on projects ranging from custom Android launchers and accessibility-based apps to machine learning systems and automation workflows. I care deeply about writing clean code, understanding why things work, and building software that feels intuitive to real users.

I’m actively preparing for full-time software engineering roles and enjoy challenging problems that require both technical depth and product thinking.

📜 My Values

- ⚡ Ownership & execution — I take responsibility from idea to delivery
- 🌱 Continuous growth — I’m always learning, unlearning, and improving
- 🧠 Clarity over noise — simple designs, clean logic, strong fundamentals
- 🤝 Honesty & professionalism — in work, communication, and collaboration
- 🚀 Building with intent — not just projects, but meaningful solutions
